Board Policy 301 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-89)

## 301.01. DIVERSITY/EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
The Kansas City Public Library is committed through its practices, programs, collections, and services creating and fostering an environment of equity, non-discrimination, and pluralism, grounded in respect and appreciation. All individuals are welcome regardless of race, color, age, national origin, sex, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender status or identity, marital status, or political affiliation. By fostering an atmosphere of diversity and inclusion, we will continue to be leaders in public discourse, address current and future community needs, and inspire a community of readers.

The Kansas City Public Library provides equal employment opportunity to all applicants for employment and all employees in accordance with the law.

The Library strictly prohibits any unlawful discrimination against applicants or employees because of their race, color, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender status or identity, age, national origin, ancestry, disability, or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status.
Employment decisions are made on the basis of bona fide occupational qualifications such as, experience, education, demonstrated performance and competency.
The Library's Human Resources Director serves as the EEO Coordinator and is responsible for monitoring and revising Library diversity efforts.
The Library also strictly prohibits in accordance with the law any harassment on the basis of sex. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, other oral and written communication or physical contact of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; (2) submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an employee is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
If an employee believes that he or she has been subject to treatment in violation of this Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, or if an employee has information relating to the treatment of a fellow employee and possible violation of this policy, the employee should immediately report it to any supervisor, manager, officer or, if the employee prefers, the Human Resources Director. A dedicated voice mail box 816.701.3533 in the Human Resources Department is available for employees to use to report harassment. There will be no retaliation against an employee for reporting unlawful discrimination or harassment. When possible and at the employee's request, the matter will remain confidential. Should a supervisor witness or suspect that a violation of the EEO policy has occurred whether in their immediate work area or not, it must be reported and investigated.
All employees, including the complainant and the respondent, are required to cooperate with an investigation of harassment. Persons who are asked to provide testimony are expected to cooperate fully and truthfully and to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation. Employees who fail to cooperate or who provide false testimony may be subject to disciplinary action ranging from a written warning to termination.
All employees are required to accept responsibility for maintaining the Library free of unlawful discrimination or harassment. The Library will not tolerate unlawful discrimination or harassment against employees or applicants for employment.

## 301.012. AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT STATEMENT
THE KANSAS CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY is committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). It is the Library's policy not to discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of such individual's disability or perceived disability so long as the employee can perform the essential functions of the job. Consistent with this policy of nondiscrimination, the Library will provide reasonable accommodations to a qualified individual with a disability, as defined by the ADA, who has made the Library aware of his or her disability, provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue hardship on the Library.

Employees with a disability who believe they need a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of their job should contact the Human Resources Department. THE KANSAS CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY encourages individuals with disabilities to come forward and request reasonable accommodation.

On receipt of an accommodation request, the Human Resources Department and the employee’s manager will meet with the employee to discuss and identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and the potential accommodation that THE KANSAS CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY might make to help overcome those limitations.

THE KANSAS CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY will determine the feasibility of the requested accommodation considering various factors, including, but not limited to the nature and cost of the accommodation, THE KANSAS CITY PUBLIC Library’s overall financial resources, and the impact on operations, including its impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties, and on THE KANSAS CITY PUBLIC Library’s ability to conduct business. The Library will inform the employee of its decision on the accommodation request or on how to make the accommodation. If the accommodation request is denied, employees will be advised of their right to appeal the decision by submitting a written statement explaining the reasons for the request to the Library Director. If the request on appeal is denied, that decision is final.

An employee or job applicant who has questions regarding this policy or believes that he or she has been discriminated against based on a disability should notify the Human Resources Department. All such inquiries or complaints will be treated as confidential to the extent permissible by law.

# 304. CLASSIFICATION PLAN
A classification plan covering all Library positions will be maintained by the Human Resources Coordinator and the Library Director. The purpose of this plan is to group into classes of positions those jobs which are similar enough in nature, difficulty and responsibility as to warrant the same rate or range of pay; to provide guidelines for minimum qualifications for a position; and to compensate employees for continued superior service and increased skills and knowledge.

The plan consists of: (1) a complete job description for each library position, (2) a position classification schedule stipulating the basic requirements for each classification's placement on the salary schedule and (3) a salary schedule showing annually established pay ranges and the classifications which are to be compensated within each pay range.

Board Policy 304 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-89)

Promotion. When an employee is promoted to an open position, one which exists as a result of reclassification, or a position created through reorganization; the employee will normally move to the beginning of the new salary grade or receive a minimum of a five percent salary increase. The new salary will be determined by the Deputy Director, Human Resources and Library Director. An employee's merit date will also be adjusted to coincide with the new effective date.

Demotion, Involuntary. Employees demoted due to performance will be assigned a lower salary effective the beginning of the next pay period which will be based on tenure, qualifications and experience. The new salary will be assigned within the appropriate classification and grade of that classification and will normally reflect a minimum of a five percent reduction in salary.

Employees demoted by management for reasons other than performance will experience a salary reduction depending on their present salary and where their salary falls in the new classification and appropriate salary grade in accordance with policy #306.03. The merit date will be adjusted .

Demotion, Voluntary. In the event of a voluntary demotion, an employee will be paid in the new classification and salary grade according to experience and qualifications. In most cases, the employee's salary will be decreased at least five percent depending on the level of the new position.

Administrative Procedure 304.022 (Adopted 8-90/Rev. 12-02/Rev. 1-08)

## 304.023. LATERAL TRANSFERS
Employees who increase hours, or move from one position to another but remain in the same classification normally experience no salary adjustment. The merit date will remain the same.

Administrative Procedure 304.025 (Adopted 7-98)

## 304.03. SALARY SCHEDULE
A salary schedule showing established pay ranges and the classifications which are to be compensated within each pay range will be recommended annually to the Library Board for approval. Compensation for each classification will be set to maintain internal consistency and external comparability with similar positions in the local and regional job market. The salary schedule adopted by the Board will include any salary adjustments approved for the year and will generally take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year. All employees are required to be paid within the range for their classification unless otherwise determined by the Library Director.

Administrative Procedure 304.07 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 7-00)

# 306. REDUCTION IN FORCE
Reduction in force occurs when it is impossible or infeasible to continue personnel strength at its existing level. The library administration shall develop appropriate procedures to maintain as high a level of library service as possible and to be fair to all members of the staff whenever a reduction in force becomes necessary.

Board Policy 306 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-89)

## 306.01. STAFF REDUCTION/REORGANIZATION
Reorganization of library operations will be the basis for determining which staff members will be retained, displaced or released in each unit of the organization such as branch services or departments. If a job is eliminated, the displaced employee must be transferred or released.

An employee to be displaced may:

Be assigned to a position in the same classification provided she/he meets both the qualifications and seniority requirements.
Be assigned to a position in a lower classification provided she/he meets both the qualifications and seniority requirements.
Be assigned to a part-time position for which he or she meets both the qualifications and seniority requirements.
Qualify for, but refuse to accept, an assignment. If this action is taken, it will be construed as a resignation.
Be released because of lower seniority than incumbents in any remaining positions.
Retain their higher salary for six months after moving to a lower paying position. After six months, if the salary was above the new range and level, it will be adjusted, not to exceed the top of the classification and assigned step, as determined by the Library Director, Deputy Director or Human Resources.

## 306.02. PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT REDUCTION IN FORCE POLICY
Should a reduction in force be necessary, supervisors will give as much notice as possible (usually 60 calendar days or more) to individual staff members, and supervisors and Human Resources will provide staff with personnel policies and procedures regarding the reduction.

If staff reduction is required, the Library Administration will determine whether displaced employees meet the qualifications of the job description for specific remaining positions. The Administration will also select the positions for which displaced employees are thought to be best qualified. Determination of qualifications will be based on training, experience and demonstrated ability.

The displaced employee may accept a new assignment or refuse by resigning. If the employee resigns, he or she may become eligible for unemployment benefits. Eligibility will be determined by the appropriate office of the Division of Employment Security.

Employees to be released because of their failure to meet the qualifications and seniority requirements for any position in the system, will be given 60 calendar days' notice or the equivalent in notice pay. Job counseling assistance will be offered whenever practical to help displaced workers seek other employment. Local employment resources will be notified, when appropriate, of upcoming reductions.

Administrative Procedure 306.02 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 12-02)

## 306.03. REDUCTION IN CLASSIFICATION
As circumstances change, it may become necessary to increase or decrease the number of employees assigned to any given unit of the Library. These circumstances may involve a shift in the workload or demand for service.

If the duties of a position are significantly reduced, either in quantity or level of responsibility, the position may be reduced to a lower classification.

If a position is reduced, the incumbent will continue to be paid at the same rate as previously for a period of six months. After that, the employee's salary will be adjusted not to exceed the top of the classification as determined by the Library Director, Deputy Director and Human Resources.

If the incumbent of a reduced position is transferred to another position, he or she will be evaluated at the end of the six months on the new job to see if the new duties are being satisfactorily performed. If they are not, every effort will be made to place the staff member appropriately before resorting to termination of employment.

Special consideration may be given to staff who have been employed by the Kansas City Public Library for twenty-five or more years, so that they will not suffer undue loss. Every effort will be made to continue their salaries at no more than a 15% reduction, whatever their new assignment.

## 307.08. WORKERS' COMPENSATION
The Library carries Workers' Compensation Insurance in compliance with state law. This insurance provides compensation for a percentage of lost time; medical expenses; surgical expenses; and loss of life or dismemberment from injury arising out of, or in the course of, an employee's job assignment with the Library. To protect his/her interests in case of an injury or illness that she/he considers work-connected, an employee should be guided by the following:

The employee must report his/her injury or illness as soon as possible to the supervisor or Human Resources.
The employee must also complete an incident/injury report within 24 hours.
If complications arise in connection with a injury or illness while an employee is away from the Library, she/he should report to the supervisor and Human Resources by telephone.
All employee medical expenses will be paid for all eligible injuries. The employee may also collect compensation for time lost because of the injury but may not collect both Worker's Compensation and sick leave pay but may choose to supplement lost pay with other accrued time. Coverage for injuries to employees on the job is excluded from the employee health insurance policy coverage.

Questions pertaining to Workers' Compensation should be directed to Human Resources.

Administrative Procedure 307.08 (Adopted 7-95/Rev. 7/99)

## 307.09. HEALTH CARE CONTINUATION BENEFITS (ALSO REFERRED TO AS COBRA AND HIPAA)
In accordance with federal law (PL99-272, Title X), the Library offers full-time employees and their covered dependents the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage at group rates in certain instances where coverage under one of the Library's health plans would otherwise end. Employees and/or their covered dependents will be notified when appropriate so that they may exercise their right to this continued coverage. Instances where this is applicable include, but are not limited to, the reduction in scheduled hours of employment from full-time to part-time status and the termination of employment for reasons other than gross misconduct. This continuation coverage is strictly at the individual's expense.

In addition, in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act each exiting employee will also be notified of prior coverage provisions.

Administrative Procedure 307.09 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 7-98)

## 307.091. LEAVE REPLACEMENT COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Full-time employees are not eligible for this program.

Leave replacement compensation consists of a specified percentage of each part-time employee's salary for the previous year. To receive this compensation, an employee must have been employed for a minimum of six months, successfully completed the job introductory period and have received a paycheck from the Library for the last pay period of the year.

## 307.10. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN/TAX SHELTERED ANNUITY PLANS
As a non-profit organization, the Library is able to offer employees special deferred compensation and tax sheltered annuity plans. Through these plans, before-tax dollars may be used to purchase an annuity. The dollars earn interest (also tax-deferred) for an employee's account until he/she retires or withdraws the money from the account.

Any regular status employee may participate in the Deferred Compensation Program. A salary reduction agreement must be signed before the first of the month when participation is to begin. An employee's contribution to either program will be payroll deducted. The salary reduction agreement continues as long as an employee remains with the Library or until he or she terminates it. Information regarding the Deferred Compensation/Tax Sheltered Annuity programs is available through the Library's Human Resources Department.

Administrative Procedure 307.11 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 12-02)

## 307.12. EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The Kansas City Public Library recognizes that personal and work problems can often be dealt with successfully when identified early and referred to appropriate care. Therefore, the Library provides employee assistance services to full and part-time employees and to members of their immediate family. The Library's EAP (Employee Assistance Program) provides an opportunity for all employees to obtain confidential assistance in resolving personal and work problems as the need arises. Further, while there is no intent to intrude upon employee's personal lives, it is appropriate when there are indications of declining work performance, attendance or behavioral problems that employees be offered professional and confidential assistance to resolve their problems. The EAP deals with the broad range of human problems including: emotional/behavioral, family and marital, alcohol and/or drug, financial, legal, work and other personal problems. The EAP provides problem assessment, short-term counseling and referral. Costs for these services are covered by the Library. Costs incurred for other services not covered by insurance or other benefits are the responsibility of the employee.

The policy applies to all full and part-time employees of the Library no matter what their job title or responsibilities.
The program is available to employees or members of their immediate family on a self-referral basis since problems at home can affect the job. If employees or immediate family members have personal or work problems that may benefit from assistance, they are encouraged to use the program.
Participation in the program will not jeopardize an employee's job security, promotional opportunities or reputation.
All records and discussions of personal or work problems will be handled in a confidential manner. These records will be kept by the EAP and will not become a part of the employee's personnel file
Employees will be encouraged to seek assistance to determine if personal or work problems are causing unsatisfactory job performance. Participation in the program is the personal choice of the individual.
All levels of management are responsible for using this program when appropriate to assist in resolving job performance problems related to personal problems.
Sick leave may be granted for treatment or rehabilitation on the same basis as for other health problems. Time off without pay will also be given when needed or when the employee has no sick leave accrual, such as with part-time employees.
This policy is not intended to supplant the normal disciplinary process or any way block access to the grievance procedures. Employees have the choice of accepting or rejecting a management referral to the EAP. If the employee accepts the EAP's assistance, it is the employee's option whether or not to give written consent for the EAP to provide the referring supervisor or manager with the following information: whether the employee has contacted the EAP and whether or not the employee is following recommendations. No information regarding the nature of the employee's problem will be given to the Library or the employee's supervisor.
Employees participating in the EAP are expected to meet existing work performance standards.

Administrative Procedure 307.12 (Adopted 11-95/Rev. 9-96)

# 308. HOLIDAYS, VACATION AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
## 308.01. HOLIDAYS
The Kansas City Public Library recognizes the following paid holidays for all regular full-time employees:

New Year's Day
Independence Day
Martin Luther King's Birthday
Labor Day
President's Day
Thanksgiving Day
Memorial Day
Christmas Day
Full-time Staff. If a paid holiday falls on a scheduled day off or during a scheduled vacation, a full-time employee may, with the prior approval of his/her supervisor, extend his/her day off or scheduled vacation by one (1) day for each holiday falling within the vacation period or on a scheduled day off.

Part-time Staff. Employees whose normal schedule includes a day of the week when the Library will be closed for a holiday will be allowed to make up the missed time only at the convenience of the Library.

Rate. The rate for holiday pay will be based solely on the employee's regular straight rate of pay at the time of the holiday.

All regular full-time employees earn 2 hours of floating holiday/personal leave per full pay period. This type of leave accrues to a maximum of 52 hours at any time. Personal/holiday time is prorated when an employee fails to be paid for a complete pay period. Use of holiday/personal leave should be authorized by supervisors in advance except in emergencies. The rate of pay for holiday/personal leave should be as above for holidays. Employees who separate from the Library with holiday/personal leave hours credited to their account will be compensated for those hours at their current hourly rate.

Administrative Procedure 308.01 (Adopted 3-83/Rev. 7-00/Rev 1-08)

## 308.02. VACATION ENTITLEMENT
Accrual rates. Regular full-time employees earn vacation time beginning the first pay period worked. Vacation time for all regular full-time employees is based on the employee's status with the library and/or length of service and will be earned as follows:

Employees in non-professional positions (those classed as Library Associate or below) with less than five (5) full years of employment: 4.615 hours vacation leave per full pay period or fifteen working days each year.

Employees in skilled or professional positions (those classed as Technical/ Maintenance/ Skilled or above) or any regular full-time employee having completed five (5) full years of regular employment as part-time or full-time: 6.15 hours vacation leave per full pay period or twenty working days each year.

Vacation time shall not exceed 320 hours on June 30 of each year. Any vacation time in excess of the 320 hours will be converted to hours in the individual's sick leave bank. In some situations, employees shall have "grandparented" vacation maximums which were established on June 30, 1995. Excess hours will be handled the same.

Pay out. Unused accrued vacation time up to 320 hours will be paid upon termination of employment at the employee's current rate of pay. Accrued vacation hours in excess of 320 will be rolled over into the individual’s sick leave bank. Full-time employees moving to part-time status and those resigning to join the substitute pool will also have vacation time paid out after all full times hours are paid.

Vacation shall be scheduled upon the prior approval of supervisors, preferably with at least one month's notice, and must be taken at the convenience of the Library.

If a paid holiday falls during a scheduled vacation, the vacation may be extended with prior supervisory approval by one (1) day or the employee may retain the additional vacation day for future use.

Vacation pay will be based solely on the employee's regular straight rate of pay at the time the vacation is taken. Employees will not be paid in lieu of using vacation time except upon retirement or termination from the Library.

Once a year, upon approval of the Library Director, an optional payout of future vacation leave accruals for up to 40 hours may be offered to eligible employees. To be eligible to opt-in for the optional payout, an employee must have at least 2 weeks or 80 hours of combined vacation/personal holiday time remaining after the vacation payout occurs. The Human Resources Director will communicate the process and guidelines for the payout.

Advancing vacation. Only in exceptional and unusual circumstances and with the prior approval of the Human Resources Director may employees take vacation in excess of unused vacation benefits earned. Vacation benefits do not accrue while an employee is on unpaid time.

Part-time. Part-time employees may take unpaid vacations not to exceed four "work" weeks in any calendar year. A week equals the equivalent number of hours a part-time person would normally work.

Administrative Procedure 308.02 (Adopted 3-83/Rev. 12-02/Rev 1-08/Rev 7-12/Rev 5-15/Rev 7-16/Rev 10-18)

## 308.03. SICK/MEDICAL AND FUNERAL LEAVE
Earning Sick Leave. Regular full-time employees shall earn and accrue paid sick leave. Paid sick leave is earned at the rate of 3.69 hours per full pay period (twelve [12] days per year).

In addition to regular sick leave accrual, an employee's sick leave bank may grow due to the transfer of vacation hours which were accrued over eligible maximums.

Unused accrued sick leave will be paid upon termination of employment at the employee's current pay rate according to the following formula, provided the same is permitted by applicable law:

— Hours of earned unused sick leave, up to a maximum of 900 hours, multiplied by years of service multiplied by three percent up to a maximum of 75 percent.

Employees who had over 900 sick leave hours accrued as of July 1, 2012 shall have a "grandfathered" maximum of sick leave eligible for pay out. If the sick leave balance of a grandfathered employee falls below the previously established grandfathered maximum on June 30, the grandfathered maximum for payout purposes will be reduced to reflect the balance in effect on June 30.

Use of Sick Leave. When an employee is ill, the appropriate supervisor or a member of the Library Office staff should be notified before the employee's scheduled starting time. Please see Section 311.07 of the Policy and Procedure Manual for more information on reporting absences.

Sick leave is primarily intended for use in cases of an employee's illness, temporary disability or for medical/dental appointments. It may also be used by either parent in conjunction with an approved leave of absence due to the arrival of a newborn child, newly adopted or foster child. This time off must be scheduled in advance with the employee's supervisor.

Extended Illness Provisions. After three days of absence for personal illness, an employee is normally required to submit a physician's verification stating the nature of the illness before sick leave is granted. When it reasonably appears that an employee will return to work within five working days and with the prior approval of the supervisor and Human Resources Director, an employee may take paid sick leave in excess of the amount accrued.

Employees on sick leave are to return to work as soon as medically feasible. Employees returning to work after extended leave are required to supply the Library with a doctor's statement certifying they are able to return to their normal duties.

If an employee with illness or temporary disability wishes to work until some future date when medical assistance or surgery is available or timely, the Library reserves the right to request periodic statements from the employee's doctor (or to have such an evaluation made by a doctor selected and paid by the Library) to certify that continued work will not adversely affect the employee's health. Employees who continue to work during illness or disability will be required to discontinue working if so advised by a physician.

Use of Sick Leave for Family Members and Domestic Partners. Sick leave can also be used by the employee in the event of the personal illness of a member of one's immediate family. Immediate family is interpreted to mean the employee's father, mother, spouse, domestic partner, sister, brother, child or anyone of like relationship by marriage. After three days of absence for the illness of an immediate family member, an employee may be required to submit a certificate signed by a physician stating the extent and nature of the illness before the additional sick leave is allowed. Employees needing extended time off to provide family care may then utilize policy #308.05.

Sick Time Use for Bereavement Leave. Employees may use sick time to prepare for a funeral or attend the funeral or grieve the death of a member of the employee's immediate family (as defined in the paragraph above). Such use of sick time is limited to 5 consecutive work days.

Pay Out. Prorated sick leave, up to a maximum of 900 hours is paid out to full-time employees when terminating employment, moving to part-time or moving to substitute status.

Medical Leave. Employees needing extended time away from work due to illness, surgery, or other medically defined reasons may use accrued sick leave and should apply for a leave of absence when it appears the absence will be of a defined or lengthy duration.

Administrative Procedure 308.03 (Adopted 3-83/Rev. 12-02/Rev 1-08/Rev 7-12)

The length of a leave depends on the type of leave. No leaves, except education leaves, will normally extend beyond 12 weeks.
Employees granted leaves of absence will generally be allowed to return to the position formerly held, with the same personnel classification and rate of pay. Details relating to the specific placement of an employee will be negotiated in advance of a leave being granted and will be outlined authorizing a specific leave of absence.
Leaves due to Workers Compensation reasons follow the policies and provisions of the Family Leave Act, 1993.
Benefit Provisions

A full-time employee may continue health and dental coverage during the leave. The cost is dependent upon the type of leave and the employee's pay status. Upon return to work from a FMLA leave or military leave, if the employee has discontinued medical or dental benefits, he/she may have coverage restored as if the leave had not been taken. All other leaves require compliance with benefit enrollment guidelines.
Part-time employees may continue to receive supplement reimbursements for health and dental coverage if on a Family Medical Leave or military leave. Employees on such leaves must have proof that premiums for the coverage were paid during the leave.
Full-time employees may use eligible accrued paid leave benefits during any approved leave of absence.
When members are on leave of absence without pay, they must make monthly contributions to the retirement fund if they wish to continue building their service record for retirement eligibility. When a full-time employee takes a leave of absence without pay, the Kansas City School District Retirement Office will notify him or her of the steps necessary to protect his/her retirement eligibility.
Library sponsored Life and disability insurance premiums for full-time employees on approved unpaid leaves are suspended during the leave period.
Leaves due to Workers Compensation reasons are restricted under the general provisions of the Family Leave Act, 1993.
Administrative Procedure 308.04 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 12-02)

## 308.05. FAMILY MEDICAL AND PERSONAL ILLNESS LEAVE
The Library provides family and medical leaves in accordance with applicable law, including the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and subject to 308.04 above.

An “eligible full-time employee” is one who has been employed for at least twelve (12) months and must have provided 1,250 hours of service during that period.

The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Eligible employees are entitled to:

Twelve workweeks of leave in a 12-month period for:
the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth;
the placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child within one year of placement;
to care for the employee’s spouse, domestic partner, child, stepchild, or parent who has a serious health condition;
a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job;
any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on “covered active duty;” or
Twenty-six workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the service member’s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).
Leave does not necessarily have to be taken all at once. Leave may be taken on an intermittent basis (i.e., one week per month) or on a reduced schedule basis (four or five hours per day). Intermittent or reduced schedule leave taken for a serious health condition — either of the employee or of an immediate family member — may be taken "if medically necessary." The employee’s manager and the Human Resources Department must approve intermittent or reduced-schedule leave taken for the birth or adoption of a child.

If an employee's request for intermittent leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee may be required to transfer temporarily to an alternative position (with equivalent pay and benefits) in order to better accommodate repeated periods of absence.

Employees are to give thirty (30) days’ notice for leave taken for the birth or adoption of a child, assuming the employee is able to give such notice; if not, the employee must give such notice as is practicable. For leave taken on the basis of planned medical treatment, employees should seek to schedule the treatment so as to avoid unduly disrupting the operations of the Library.

The Library will require the employee to first use his or her VACATION AND SICK LEAVE time for any part of the twelve (12) week period. If such paid leave is not available, the Library provides unpaid leave to total twelve (12) weeks.

With leave taken on the basis of a serious health condition, the Library may require the employee to provide certification of the condition and the fact that the employee is unable to perform his or her job functions, or certification of the fact that the employee is needed to care for a family member. In the case of intermittent leave, this certification must also provide the dates and duration of the treatments to be given. The Library has the right to seek a second opinion at its expense. Such information will be obtained and such exams will be conducted in accordance with the ADA. All medical information will be maintained in confidence in accordance with the ADA.

Upon return to work, the employee will be restored to the position he or she held when the leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms or conditions of employment.

In addition, leave does not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date the leave began (except insofar as the employee is required to exhaust accrued paid leave). The employee is not entitled to any right, benefit or position of employment other than that to which he or she would have been entitled if no leave had taken place.

If the employee is an employee within the highest-paid 10 percent of the Library workforce, obligations and options will be discussed at the time the benefit is requested.

During the period of leave, if the employee is enrolled in the group health plan, it will be offered to the employee for the duration of the leave at the level and under the conditions that the coverage would have been offered if no leave had taken place. If the employee fails to return to work at the end of the leave, the Library has the option and may recoup the premiums paid for maintaining health coverage. Health coverage costs are not recouped when the employee fails to return to work due to a continuation or recurrence of a serious health condition.

If the Library or an individual branch, or a department closes during business hours, employees scheduled to work that day, including substitutes, will be paid for all hours they were scheduled to work.
If the Library, or an individual branch or department is closed the entire day or opens late because of inclement weather or unusual conditions and advance notice is not possible, all employees and substitutes will be paid for the hours they were scheduled to work.
When advance notice is possible for closings or delayed openings, employees may be assigned to another work location or if no alternative work location and/or assignment is available, employees will not be paid, and full-time employees will be required to use accrued leave time, if any, for credit toward the work week. Advance notice includes, but not limited to, closing a location for a scheduled outage or construction project or notifying employees the night before for closures or delayed openings.
Employees not scheduled to work on days when the Library is closed because of inclement weather or unusual conditions will not be compensated.
See section 313.01 regarding practices followed in determining when the library system shall be closed for inclement conditions.

Administrative Procedure 309.07 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-95, 2-19)

## 309.08. USE OF PERSONAL AUTOMOBILES
Library cars are available for conducting library business by coordinating their use through the Library Office. Personal cars may also be used for library business, including attendance at library system meetings. Employees shall be reimbursed for authorized use of their personal automobile for the benefit of the Library at the per mile rate established by the Administration. Reimbursement shall be paid by check when a claim is submitted on a mileage/expense form. Claims should be accumulated to a minimum of $10.00 before being submitted for reimbursement.

In addition, library cars are encouraged for in-state or regional events, especially when two (2) or more employees will be in attendance. Other than these approved events, library cars are restricted from being outside of the Library district after library hours.

Administrative Procedure 309.08 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 12-02)

# 310. STAFF DEVELOPMENT/CONTINUING EDUCATION
Staff development and continuing education programs supply the foundation from which employees build and maintain the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve quality library service and their own sense of job satisfaction. In recognition of this, the library shall undertake to support learning opportunities for employees through the establishment of an in-service staff development program to upgrade employees' job skills and improve library services.

Board Policy 310 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-89/Rev. 5-2007)

## 310.01. STAFF DEVELOPMENT
Responsibility. The staff development program includes but is not limited to orientation of new staff, staff meetings, written and audiovisual training materials, sponsored training events at the library, and attendance at seminars, institutes, professional meetings, conferences, and meetings of local, civic and educational organizations. The responsibility for staff development falls with the supervisor and employee as a cooperative effort between one another. Human Resources serves as a resource as well as other professionals on the Library's staff.

Supervisors are expected to provide training on: assigned duties of the employee's position, what constitutes effective performance; and plans, policies and goals of the department. In addition, the supervisor's role is to have the employee assume responsibility for their work, find means for self development and make use of the employee's special interests, knowledge and abilities. Departmental training is the responsibility of the supervisor and may be in conjunction with on-the-job training from other staff members, use of structured training, or may be informal but with specific goals in mind. The goal is to teach specific skills, techniques and procedures; to further the employee's understanding of library objectives and to enhance the knowledge needed for effective job performance.
The employee is responsible for taking advantage of learning opportunities, finding learning activities which contribute to her/his success in their position, and implementation of learned skills in their job.
Human Resources provides information on learning opportunities, works with supervisors in designing individual and/or group staff development activities, and assists staff in finding financial assistance to participate in these activities when possible.
Work-time Learning Activities. These may include but are not limited to: in-house courses, on-site training, attendance at professional meetings, conferences, pre-conferences, off-site workshops and training, user group meetings, etc. Attendance at these activities is usually through either support by one earning their regular rate of pay, payment of fees for attendance by the library, allocation of money specified as a "sponsorship," or a combination of these.

Work-time. Pay, while attending staff development activities, is usually limited to eight hours per day or may be on a workweek basis. Attendance must be requested and approved by the Library. Compensatory time may be awarded if the training program requires attendance at a formal instructional session as in the evening or if the employee is required to return to the Library for scheduled work time, and the Library finds it necessary to require a staff member to attend a specific session on library time. If the employee is not normally scheduled to work the hours of the learning activity, the employee may be allowed compensatory time at the discretion of the department head and the Library Executive Director.

Enhancement of Job Knowledge. Keeping up on current developments in one's field is another component of staff development. All professional staff are expected to keep abreast of current library literature and developments as part of their basic job responsibilities. As appropriate, supervisors also have the responsibility for sharing particular articles, books or other relevant information with their staff, which can be read on work or personal time.

Employee's Own Time. Non work-time activities can be another important aspect of the Library's staff development. Courses and activities taken on one's own time and at one's own expense help round out an employee's learning experiences.

Administrative Procedure 310.01 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-99/Rev 1-08)

## 310.03. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION INVOLVEMENT, MEETING ATTENDANCE AND CONFERENCES
All staff members are encouraged to participate and assume a leadership role in professional associations at all levels: local, regional, state, national and international. The Library believes participation provides experience, offers opportunities for professional growth and is beneficial to the Library. Prior to committing to involvement, the employee must have the approval of his/her immediate supervisor, Deputy Director or the Library Executive Director.

Qualifying Activities. Professional associations shall be defined as local, regional, state, national and international organizations that are 1) library-related (e.g. concerned with the acquisition, organization, preservation and sharing of information) or 2) related to a subject specialty with direct bearing on the employee's position with the Library. Meeting shall be defined as related to general conferences, special assemblies, workshops, institutes and committees.

Membership Fees. Membership fees are usually the responsibility of the employee. The Library also pays for institutional memberships in the Library's name, which benefit employees by allowing staff to have individual membership benefits.

Funding and Financial Support. Employees may attend activities in a variety of ways:

Sponsorship allows the employee to attend on Library time and with the Library paying the fee (does not allow use of Continuing Education money). Sponsorship may include a meeting, conference, pre-conference or other activity.
Continuing Education money can be used to attend professional association activities at the discretion of the Library Executive Director.
A combination of, sponsorship, time off and/or employee paid support may also be negotiated for attendance at professional association activities.
Determining Approval. In determining who shall be granted permission to attend professional association meetings, first priority shall be given to full-time staff members who hold office, have committee responsibilities or who are appearing on the program at such events. Beyond these considerations, attendance will be rotated among staff whose jobs are directly related to the program content. Each attendee will be responsible for giving a brief written or verbal account of the proceedings to their immediate supervisor. A request to attend a meeting or conference should be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor well in advance of travel plans. Requests require the approval of the supervisor, Deputy Director and Library Executive Director.

Time. Nonexempt staff may include documented travel time and time attending a professional association activity as work time. To avoid compensatory time at 1 1/2 times, employees and supervisors should adjust schedules accordingly. Exempt staff will normally not be paid for travel to or attendance at professional association activities if it is outside normal working hours.

Under the FLSA, travel time is considered work time for non-exempt employees in the following scenarios:

Travel time during the work day is work-related and considered hours worked.
Travel time for overnight, out of town assignments is compensable if the travel occurs during normal working hours – including those hours on regularly scheduled days off. Example, if an employee works 9 – 5:30 MWF but travels on Sunday to an out-of-town trip leaving at 8 AM and arriving at 12 noon – the employee would have 3 hours treated as hours worked (9 – 12).
Travel time outside of normal working hours spent as a passenger in a car (includes the driver), train, airplane, bus or boat is not compensable under the FLSA unless work is performed during that time.
If the employees decide to carpool, and they travel from 6 PM to 9 PM, then the time for everyone in the car is not compensable.
Administrative Procedure 310.03 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-99/Rev 1-08/Rev 7-16)

## 310.04. CLAIMING REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRAVEL OR CONFERENCE EXPENSE
Travel for Library business is either "local" or "out-of-area." Local travel is defined as being within the state of Missouri or in an adjoining state within 180 miles of the Library. Local travel does not typically include the need for overnight accommodations. Out-of-area travel generally involves commercial transportation and one or more nights of accommodation. All out-of-area travel at Library expense must be approved in advance by the Board of Trustees. Local travel must be approved in advance administratively.

Local Travel. To be reimbursed for local travel, an employee must have received prior supervisory and administrative approval. Upon completion of the travel, the employee should submit a "Mileage/Expense Reimbursement Claim" for mileage reimbursement for the use of their personal vehicle and reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses. Receipts or other documentation substantiating the claim must be attached to the form.

Out-of-Area Travel. Out-of-area travel must be approved in advance both administratively and by the Board of Trustees. Reimbursement is usually based on a stipend or daily stipend rate. Claiming reimbursement requires completion of the "Travel Expense Reimbursement Claim" form within 10 working days after return from the trip. The Library will reimburse reasonable and prudent expenses up to the maximum amount allowed. Eligible expenses may include mileage from home to commercial carrier, commercial travel, airport fees for parking, lodging expenses, meals (at no more than the Federal reimbursement) and miscellaneous expenses (up to a maximum of $25 per day) for tips, gratuities and local transportation. All expenses must be itemized on the reimbursement claim form with the original receipts attached when possible and practical. Receipts or other documentation for hotel and commercial transportation expense must be attached for reimbursement.

Approved travel stipends may include prepaid commercial transportation and/or registration provided the employee allows the Library to make the commercial travel arrangements and registration information is provided to the Library within prescribed time lines. Employees bear the responsibility of charges made for changes in travel arrangements should the cost of the change and new ticket price exceed the original amount arranged. When the Library prepays the commercial travel and/or registration, these amounts come from the stipend amount when reimbursement is requested.

Administrative Procedure 310.04 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-99)

## 310.05. EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
General Assistance. The Library has an educational assistance program that provides tuition, fee and/or registration fee payments to staff members within the guidelines of 310.06 and 310.07. Assistance is provided on a prepaid basis when requests are made according to deadlines established in Human Resources. Eligible employees must be in good standing with the Library (i.e. not on disciplinary probation), and have successfully completed their initial six month Introductory Period.

Loan Program. In addition to the Library's educational assistance program, Human Resources coordinates an educational loan program, which was started through support of the Friends of the Library. Approved loans are available for items not covered by (or in excess of) the Educational assistance program or out of area travel costs, or in lieu of library funding for educational purposes. Eligible expenses may include: books, course materials, fees, tuition; and costs related to other library or job related continuing education activities, such as expenses related to conference attendance. All loans are arranged without interest or fees. Repayment is arranged through convenient payroll deduction. Details are available in Human Resources and on the Staff Web.

Administrative Procedure 310.05 (Adopted 12-87/revised 7-00)

## 310.06. ACADEMIC CREDIT COURSE WORK ASSISTANCE
Definition. Regular status part-time and full-time Library employees (Attendant classification and above) are eligible for partial or full tuition and registration fee reimbursement. Courses must be library related, job related, part of a general degree program (AA, BA or BS), or towards a graduate degree that is highly job related. Courses taken must be from accredited higher education institutions. Courses or the degree sought should enable an employee to advance within the Library's structure. Such reimbursement is limited to a specified amount determined each fiscal year per credit hour, cannot exceed 6 hours in any calendar year, and is limited to funding availability.

Requirements. The employee must:

meet the qualifications in 310.05; and
apply and be approved in advance of taking the course (see Append.: 310.06); and
request educational assistance only for tuition and fees which have not been paid through any other grant or scholarship; and
attain a grade of "C" for undergraduate or "B" for graduate courses, or better to avoid having to reimburse the assistance amount to the Library.
Administrative Procedure 310.06 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 1-98)

## 310.07. NON-ACADEMIC CREDIT WORK ASSISTANCE
Definition. Employees (eligible for academic credit course work reimbursement? See "Eligibility") are eligible for a maximum amount, as determined each fiscal year, for unlimited workshops, audited courses, institutes or non-academic courses that are job or library-related. Use of any of the money for payment of non-academic activities reduces the benefit for academic courses from six to three credit hours.

Aide Eligibility. All employees classified as Library Aide and above are eligible for non-academic money, up to a maximum amount, as determined each fiscal year for unlimited workshops, audited courses, institutes, or other non-academic courses that are job or library related after being employed for at least one year in a regular part or full-time position. While an Aide, an employee cannot receive academic moneys, but if he or should transfer into a position classified at the level of Attendant or above, then he/she will fall within the full guidelines of 310.5 and 310.6 immediately.

Administrative Procedure 310.07 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 7-99)

## 310.08. CONDITIONS OF REIMBURSEMENT AND VERIFICATION
Use of Funds. Continuing education money for academic work and/or non-academic course work, conference attendance, or other eligible learning activities allows an employee to receive continuing education units (if requested and approved) as long as the attendance is on the employee's own time and the activity was approved in advance.

Verification. E-mail or other written verification of satisfactory continuing education activity completion must be submitted to the employee's supervisor(s) and forwarded to Human Resources within 30 days of the last day of the learning activity or the Library has the right to begin payroll deducting the money.

Conditions of Receipt. Payment of continuing education money to any employee implies the employee agrees to remain in the Library's employment for six months after completion of the class and workshop. Failure to continue employment for six months will normally result in the employee being required to pay back the education assistance received by deducting the assistance paid from the employee's last check. Any employee who resigns or is discharged prior to satisfactory completion of the course for which she/he received payment shall have the full amount of money received deducted from her/his last pay or severance check.

Re-Payment Courtesy. Funds from stipends and sponsorships do not have a repayment provision, although the Library encourages staff to not attend professional meetings, conferences, etc. if the employee has reason to believe she/he cannot or will not remain in the Library's employment for six months after the event.

Administrative Procedure 310.071 (Adopted 10-90/Rev. 12-02)

## 310.09. EDUCATIONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Employees who are enrolled in library or highly job related degree programs will be eligible, upon the approval of the Library Director, for up to one year of unpaid educational leave-of-absence during the pursuit of the degree. For additional information regarding educational leaves, see section 308.07 above.

Administrative Procedure 310.08 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 7-95)

## 310.10. INCOME TAX AND EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE
The taxing status of educational benefits will be in accordance with current Internal Revenue Service codes. Employees are encouraged to contact the Library's payroll staff prior to applying for educational assistance for current status.

Administrative Procedure 310.10 (Adopted 12-87/Rev. 9-96)

# 311. GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
The purpose of this section of the manual is to communicate basic information regarding the Library's expectations as an employer. Information contained in the manual should not be regarded as a substitute for discussion between an employee and his/her supervisor in matters of job-related questions or concerns. Employees are encouraged to consult their supervisors for further guidance in all such areas. In establishing guidelines, it is not the intention of the Library to restrict employees' rights, but rather to protect the rights and increase the safety and happiness of all employees.

Administrative Procedure 311 (Adopted 8-86)

## 311.01. "COFFEE" AND DINNER BREAKS
Staff members may request one fifteen-minute coffee break for each continuous 4 hours worked. Break time is considered work time, and the employee is considered "on call" during that time.

Breaks should never be taken at the expense of service to the public. When staff shortages occur, it may become necessary to reschedule or cancel break periods. Break time cannot be saved, added to lunch or dinner time or added to any kind of leave. Also, breaks cannot be used to leave work early or to cover for late arrivals.

One half-hour of an employee's own time is allowed for lunch. At the discretion of their supervisors, full-time employees who work an eight-hour shift may take one hour of their own time for their meal period.

Administrative Procedure 311.01 (Adopted 9-86/Rev. 7-99)

## 311.02. INTRODUCTORY PERIOD
Each new employee appointed to a library position must serve a six-month introductory period.

Purpose of the Introductory Period. The introductory period allows employees the opportunity to decide if they enjoy working at the Library and want to continue with it. It gives the Library the opportunity to initially evaluate the employee's interest in the job and ability to carry out its requirements effectively. During this period the employee's supervisor will periodically counsel the employee, performing formal evaluation at the end of the third month in a position and again just prior to the end of the six-month introductory period. In no case should completion of the introductory period be interpreted to mean that the library's ability to terminate employees in its sole discretion is in any way restricted after that period. Training and evaluation are on-going processes. The six-month introductory period should not be considered as an employment contract of six months.
Procedures For Failing to Successfully Complete. Employees dismissed during the introductory period shall be notified on the same date in which the termination becomes effective. The employee will however be paid through that day except as outlined in SECTION 311.08(3).
Promoted or Transferred Employees. A Library employee who has been promoted to a new position at a higher classification must similarly serve a six month introductory period. He/she will be counseled and evaluated as outlined above for new employees. A promoted employee who fails to meet required performance standards may be returned to his/her previous position if still available, or an equivalent position, at his/her previous classification and salary without prejudice.
Inter-department transfers from one Library position to another, where no change in classification would result, do not require a formal introductory period with formal performance reviews at specified times. However, an informal trial period may be set to insure that both the employee and his/her supervisor are satisfied with the transfer.
Extended Introductory Periods. In special situations, such as absence during the introductory period because of extended sickness or accident by either the supervisor or employee, the introductory period may be extended if an extension is deemed to be in the best interest of both the employee and the Library. The length of any such extension shall be based on the recommendation of the employee's supervisor with the approval of the Human Resources Coordinator and the Deputy Director.
Adjustments. Employees in the Introductory Period are treated as any other employees regarding cost of living adjustments and benefits.
Administrative Procedure 311.02 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-95)

## 311.03. PROMOTION DURING INTRODUCTORY PERIOD
It is recommended that employees complete their introductory period before applying for promotion or lateral transfer. However, introductory status shall not automatically prohibit an employee from making such an application. Any promotion or transfer awarded an employee during his/her introductory period will require the establishment of a new introductory period of six months effective with the date of the appointment to the new position.

Administrative Procedure 311.03 (Adopted 8-86)

## 311.04. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
The Library has no objection to employees accepting second jobs unless such jobs have negative effects on the employees' abilities to satisfy the job-related requirements of their positions at the Library or involve the use of confidential information learned directly or indirectly through employment at the Library. Because of scheduling considerations, employees who hold or plan to hold a second job should advise their immediate supervisor. Should outside employment appear to interfere with or prevent an employee from fully discharging the responsibilities of his/her position with the Library, the situation will be called to the attention of the employee with the expectation that adjustments necessary to permit satisfactory service to the Library will be made.

Administrative Procedure 311.04 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 9-96)

## 311.05. RETIREMENT AGE
This policy is under revision.

## 311.06. EXIT INTERVIEW
It is recommended that exiting employees complete an Exit Interview form (found on the Staff Web) close to their last day of employment and send that to the Human Resources Director. Resigning, retiring or dismissed employees may also elect to participate in an exit interview conducted by a member of the Library's Human Resources Department sometime during the last week of employment. The exit interview is an opportunity for the employee to convey his/her thoughts regarding work experience at the Library and offer any suggestions for improved operations.

The employee may elect to have the content of the exit interview remain confidential or be shared with appropriate other parties.

Administrative Procedure 311.06 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7/00)

## 311.07. ATTENDANCE
All Library staff members are expected to be punctual and to keep absences and tardiness to a minimum. Employees should be at their workstation on time and ready to begin work at the beginning of each shift. When this is not possible, employees should follow specific guidelines for notification provided by their supervisor or department manager.

Tardiness. Tardiness is defined as any occasion when an employee is expected to have started his/her shift a given time ready to work and is not. . When an employee expects to be late because of illness or an emergency, the employee should notify his/her supervisor before the start of work and give a projected arrival time.

An employee is required to notify the supervisory if the tardiness converts into a day of absence. If the supervisor is not available, contact the next level of supervision so that accommodations can be made to cover the work-station.

Absenteeism. Absenteeism is defined as any absence from an assigned shift(s) which was not requested and approved in advance by the employee's supervisor. Normally, "advance" means on or before the previous day. Excessive absenteeism is defined as two or more occasions per calendar month after an employee’s introductory period.

When an unexpected absence arises because of illness or an emergency, the employee must notify his/her supervisor before the start of work, or if that person is not available, the next level of supervision, so that schedule changes and coverage can be arranged.

Unreported absence is subject to a written warning after one day and will be considered as a resignation (job abandonment) after three consecutive days.

General Provisions. The supervisor is responsible for keeping records of absences and tardiness. Records, however, must be available for review by the employee, the Deputy Directors and Human Resources. Employees who are either tardy or absent during the introductory period will be evaluated on an individual basis. Depending on the circumstances, an employee may be separated during the introductory periods due to absences and/or, tardiness.

Employees who become ill or who must attend to an emergency situation while at work should advise their supervisor before leaving work. If the supervisor is unavailable, the employee should contact the acting supervisor for approval before leaving.

After proper warnings, an employee may be terminated for excessive absenteeism or tardiness even if proper notice of absences and tardiness has been given by telephone or other notification.

Administrative Procedure 311.07 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 12-02)

## 311.08. WORK RULES/RULES OF CONDUCT
The Library expects employees to exhibit regular and prompt attendance and cooperative attitudes and actions. Certain rules of conduct are essentially for fairness, equity and productivity of all personnel.

In addition to pertinent guidelines covered throughout the 300 series, misconduct that will subject employees to discipline up to and including dismissal includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Stealing or attempting to steal the property of the Library, Library users, or Library employees; or intentionally destroying Library property.
Accessing, releasing, discussing or misusing privileged or confidential information without prior authorization.
Violating the Library's equal employment opportunity guidelines and/or policies on sexual, racial or other harassment or abuse of a fellow worker.
Misrepresenting recorded hours worked or intentionally accepting pay for hours not worked.
Insubordination: failing to carry out any reasonable order of a superior or verbally abusing a superior.
Offensive conduct or language toward the public or fellow employees, including the disregarding of good customer relations.
Appearing on library grounds with an unauthorized firearm or weapon.
Excessive absenteeism or tardiness. Abuse of sick leave or approved leave-of-absence.
Misuse of Library supplies or equipment.
Violating substance use policies.
It is recognized that other behavior not specifically covered in the preceding material may warrant discipline up to and including dismissal. Activities not expressly covered in these rules will be handled on a case-by-case basis. All employees are expected to act with good common sense and in a totally professional manner.

Administrative Procedure 311.08 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 12-02)

## 311.09. EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE
It is impossible to outline procedures that should be uniformly followed in all instances requiring employee discipline. Further, it is recognized that appropriate disciplinary action always rests within the sound discretion of Library supervisors. Guidelines have been established in the interests of providing supervisors with a basic outline for effective counseling and discipline.

Administrative Procedure 311.09 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 12-91)

## 311.10. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSING OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
Library employees have a personal responsibility to meet reasonable standards of performance and behavior.
Discipline for sub-standard performance or inappropriate behavior should be corrective rather than punitive. The goal of any disciplinary action is to influence an employee to choose on-the-job behavior that assures effective job performance.
Any type of disciplinary action, including immediate suspension or dismissal, may be invoked for serious misconduct.
Disciplinary actions may take the form of counseling, written warnings, a decision-making leave, probation and/or dismissal.
Because this is a progressive system of discipline, failure to correct or improve after a disciplinary step will cause subsequent discipline to proceed to the next step.
In determining the appropriateness of any disciplinary action, legitimate mitigating factors should be taken into account. Common mitigating considerations include, but shall not be limited to, length of service, previous work record, awareness of rules violated, impact of conduct on operations and/or the library's handling of the offense.
In a disciplinary session, the supervisor should:
Determine and note what occurred, define inappropriate behavior, clearly state facts regarding the misconduct or failure to meet job requirements.
Meet with employee in private with goal of gaining employee's agreement to solve problem.
Point out specific work rule violations, sub-standard area(s) of performance or other behavior warranting counseling.
Hear employee's explanations.
Outline the desired behavior required, when it is required and why.
Advise the employee of the next step if performance or desired behavior does not occur.

Administrative Procedure 311.10 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 12-91)

## 311.11. PRE-DISCIPLINE/DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES
Counseling. Informal verbal counseling is recommended as a step to be taken prior to formal written discipline. Such counseling and related documentation should establish a baseline for acceptable and desired performance. A written summary of the counseling session should be drawn up and a copy given to the employee. Unless followed up by subsequent disciplinary action, a record of the counseling will not become a part of the employee's official personnel records as discipline.
Initial Written Warning. When informal counseling has failed to produce sustained satisfactory performance or when informal counseling is determined to be an inappropriate first step in dealing with sub-standard performance or inappropriate behavior, the next step is to hold a formal discussion with the employee and issue a formal initial warning, in written form using either a memo or Discipline Action Form. Given individual circumstances, not all situations requiring employee discipline will follow the same progression. However, in most instances a written initial warning should be preceded by counseling. The warning will document the discussion with a statement including the supervisor's account of circumstances, the employee's version, agreed-upon plan for improvement, signatures of both parties and a statement advising the employee of what action will be taken if he/she fails to improve. Also, the supervisor should give the employee a copy of the written statement and advise him/her that this is the first formal step of discipline and a copy will be placed in the personnel file.
Advanced Written Warning. An employee receives an advanced written warning, usually after an initial written warning has been given. In some cases, the severity of an infraction may merit an advanced written warning even when other steps have not been taken in the disciplinary process. At the time of the advanced written warning, an employee may be placed in a probationary period when it appears to management that the guidelines or description of the employee's expected standards of performance are unclear. Probationary periods will not exceed 60 days in length and may be divided in 2 week increments in which specific goals must be met.
Decision-Making Leave. If the date set for reviewing performance has arrived and the employee is found to be incapable or unwilling to perform satisfactorily, he or she may be placed on a paid, one-day decision-making leave, upon the advice of Human Resources. In some cases, a decision-making leave may be the first step of discipline. In other circumstances a decision-making leave may not be considered appropriate. In administering a decision-making leave, the supervisor should:
Inform the employee of the Decision-Making Leave and explain that continued employment with the Library subsequent to the leave is conditional upon the employee's decision to solve the problem and make a total commitment to acceptable performance on the job.
Instruct the employee to return after the decision-making leave and report directly to the supervisor with his/her decision to either change and stay with the Library or quit and find more satisfying work elsewhere. Any decision other than the decision to stay with the Library and make all necessary changes will result in immediate dismissal.
Document the discussion in writing, including agreed-upon action plan and provide signatures of both parties.
Give copy to employee and forward copy through appropriate supervisory channels to Human Resources to file in employee's personnel records.
To Grieve Discipline. If at any stage in disciplinary proceedings an employee feels his/her supervisor is unjustly attempting to apply discipline, he/she may call for a hearing. To obtain a hearing, an employee should follow procedures set out in Section 322.01 (Grievance and/or Complaint Resolution Procedure) of this manual.

Administrative Procedure 311.11 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-99)

## 311.12. DISMISSAL
It may be necessary to dismiss an employee who does not adapt to the policies of the Kansas City Public Library or meet performance standards. In most instances such action shall be taken only after the employee has been warned in writing about his/her performance or conduct. The "Discipline/Counseling Statement" form may be used to facilitate this process. It will normally be signed by the supervisor and acknowledged or signed by the employee, then added to the staff member's personnel file. The employee will receive a copy.

Severance Pay. Staff members who have been employed by the Library for at least one year will be given two week's pay, dismissal effective immediately (unless terminated for gross misconduct). Terminated employees are to leave the Library immediately.

Gross Misconduct. In some extreme circumstances, an employee may be dismissed without warning and with no severance pay, for example: in cases of violation of the law, willful destruction of property, falsification of application, or similar serious infractions.

Hearing Process. To protect individual rights, the employee may ask for a hearing with the Library Director. Such request should be in writing to the Director within five calendar days after dismissal notice is given. The Library Director's decision shall be administratively binding.

Administrative Procedure 311.12 (Adopted 8-85/Rev. 7-99)

# 312. EMPLOYEE CONDUCT
## 312.01. PUBLIC RELATIONS
All staff who have person-to-person or other contact with the public are required to deal with customers in a pleasant, courteous and business-like manner. Reliable guidelines for good public relations include, but are not limited to, responding promptly, cordially greeting visitors, addressing customers by name when possible, giving one's own first or last name when requested and in general making an effort to make the customer's contact with the Library a pleasant one.

Administrative Procedure 312.01 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-99)

## 312.02. TELEPHONE COURTESY
The Library considers telephone service to be as important a public service as any other business conducted. Guidelines include a prompt response, distinct diction, pleasant voice, identification of one's department, provision of one's first or last name if requested and minimizing the amount of time a caller is on hold. All are considered necessary elements in meeting Library expectations.

Administrative Procedure 312.02 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-95)

## 312.03. CLOSING PROCEDURES
Staff at the Main Library and all branches should be scheduled as late as their services are likely to be required. Staff may begin turning lights out at closing time in areas where there are no customers. A few minutes before closing, staff should go through the Library and help customers finish finding materials. No customer should be turned away from the Library until closing time.

Staff should be responsive to customers who are just coming into the Library and need something special. Staff should help customers who are in the Library past closing time in a courteous fashion. For security reasons, employees should include safety and security procedures in their individual department or location closing procedures.

Good judgment should be exercised in calling for appropriate outside emergency assistance (9ll). Accidents resulting in severe injury to an employee or customer must be verbally reported immediately with a written report within 24 hours. An Incident Form is required for all accidents.

## 312.05. DRESS
Employees serve as representatives of the Kansas City Public Library and therefore must present a professional appearance while on duty. Work attire should be appropriate to the individual's work responsibilities, work location, and position.

Appropriate dress guidelines:

Shirts: Shirts should project a professional appearance. Shirts with Library related logos are appropriate. Unacceptable attire includes tank top, shirt or blouse which is torn or transparent; and t-shirts or shirts with large logos or slogans.

Slacks: Dress slacks or khakis are preferred. Jeans may not be appropriate for all positions interacting with patrons and the public, however, if approved they are to be neat, clean, and without holes or rips. Shorts are not appropriate.

Skirts/Dresses: Appropriate length is required.

Shoes: For safety reasons, staff who lift and move items should protect feet by wearing closed toe shoes. Flip flops are not acceptable attire.

Caps: visors, hats, and bandanas are not permissible except for employees working outside.

The immediate supervisor is responsible to ensure that employee attire is appropriate to the individual's work activities, and may instruct employees who do not meet the standards of the dress code to take corrective action.

Administrative Procedure 312.05 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-98/Rev. 9-15)

## 312.06. EATING
Eating in public areas is restricted during work time and generally discouraged.

Special permission may be granted by the employee's supervisor for special occasions. Proper cleaning up is required in all cases.

## 312.08. DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE
Employee Expectations. Employees are expected and required to report to work on time and in appropriate mental and physical condition for work. It is our intent and obligation to provide a drug free, healthful, safe and secure work environment.

Reporting. Employees must, as a condition of employment, report any conviction under a criminal drug statute for violations occurring on or off Library premises while conducting library business. A report of a conviction must be made within five (5) days after the conviction. (This requirement is mandated by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988).

Prohibitions. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance on library premises or while conducting library business off library premises is absolutely prohibited. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may have legal consequences.

Testing.

When in the Library's judgment, there is reasonable suspicion that an employee has reported to work or is working impaired as a result of the use of drugs, controlled substances or alcohol, the employee may be required to submit to screening.
Employees involved in a management referral to the Employee Assistance Program in which substance use is involved as a primary or secondary issue, may be required to submit to screening periodically as a condition of continued employment.
Refusal to submit to substance screening will be considered an act of insubordination and may result in termination.
Screening Results. The screening of all urine and blood samples submitted in accordance with this policy will be performed by qualified and certified testing laboratories. The test results will be reviewed to determine if there is evidence of the use of drugs, controlled substances or alcohol. The test results will be treated in strict confidence. The laboratory will advise the Library only whether the test results were positive (indicative of the presence of drugs, controlled substances or alcohol) or negative. No test results will be released to any other party without the written authorization of the employee who was screened.

Employees who have positive test results will be required to be assessed by a substance abuse professional approved or provided by the Library, and shall complete any recommended treatment. Refusal to undergo an assessment, to comply with treatment recommendations, or to follow through with treatment will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.

Employee Assistance Program. The Library recognizes that drug and alcohol dependency is a treatable health problem. Employees needing assistance in dealing with such a problem are encouraged to consult with their manager and/or Human Resources to obtain information on the availability of resources, treatment clinics and programs.

Employees who seek assistance through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will not be disciplined for doing so. However, it is the employee's responsibility to seek assistance before they have become subject to discipline for a violation of the drug and alcohol abuse policy.

Administrative Procedure 312.08 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 9-96)

## 312.09. PERSONAL USE OF LIBRARY EQUIPMENT
Library telephones, copiers, fax machines, personal computers and other office equipment and communication media are intended for Library business. Use of this equipment for personal communication (including telefacsimile and e-mail) should be extremely limited and employees are responsible for any associated fees, costs or charges. Such personal use should never occur from a public service desk.

Administrative Procedure 312.09 (Adopted 8-86/Rev. 7-95)

## 312.10. USE OF STAFF TIME
Library employees are expected to devote time on the job entirely to their assigned responsibilities. Personal conversations, personal e-mail use, telephone conversations, performance of duties related to other organizations or interests should be conducted during breaks or lunch and dinner periods only. Inappropriate use of staff time may result in disciplinary action.

## 313.01. LIBRARY SYSTEM CLOSINGS FOR INCLEMENT CONDITIONS
Generally, the Library will not close for inclement weather conditions. Information concerning any closing of the Library will be given via Library Website, Library email, Library weather hotline 816.701.3599; and over social media. In addition, supervisors are responsible for keeping an accurate contact list of employees to be used in case of a library closing. If employees are unable to obtain the information, they should call their supervisor for the latest information. Determination of whether to close the Library will be made by the Library Director, or designee. If no notice is given, it is assumed that the Library will be open as usual.

Administrative Procedure 313.01 (Adopted 8-6/Rev. 7-00, 02-19)

## 313.02. COMMITTEE/TASK FORCE PARTICIPATION
The Library encourages staff interaction and development through involvement in committees, work/user groups and task forces. Frequently, participation in such group activities may be a function of the staff member's position, while participation in other activities may be voluntary.

Employees must obtain the approval of their immediate supervisor before committing to any in-house group activities and must have the additional approval of their Deputy Director for activities, committees, etc., outside of the Library.

Participation is open to the entire staff, but employees interested in voluntary activities should check with their supervisors before making a commitment to ensure that supervisors can provide the necessary flexibility in scheduling.

The intended purpose of the committee/task force structure is to:

improve overall communication and increase interdepartmental interaction;
increase the number of opportunities for staff from all levels of the Library to participate in skill development and continuing education;
enable staff to develop group interaction and leadership skills; and to
provide an opportunity for greater staff participation in decision making.

Criteria includes the employee meeting or exceeding the "rule of 75," (meaning age and years of service combined equal 75) AND the recipient has been employed with the Library for at least 10 years.

For employees who do not meet the above criteria, the individual's department or branch may choose to honor the person with its own gift and/or party for such things as resignations, birthdays, etc. Lunch and break times may be utilized for this purpose.

Holiday celebratory parties "sponsored" by the Library shall also fall within financial guidelines set annually by the Library Director and the Finance Director.

Individuals who question the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in their files should bring such matters to the attention of management in writing. The Human Resources Director, in consultation with the employee's supervisor, when appropriate, will consider the employee's objections and correct or remove erroneous or improper information.

## 322.01. GRIEVANCE AND/OR COMPLAINT RESOLUTION PROCEDURE
If an employee has good cause to believe that he or she has been treated or disciplined unfairly or in a manner inconsistent with Library policy, the following procedure should be utilized to achieve fair and equitable resolution of the matter at the lowest possible supervisory or administrative level.

Step 1: The employee should discuss the situation with her/his immediate supervisor who will attempt to resolve the matter within the framework of established policy, and administrative procedure.

Step 2: If the employee's supervisor is unable to resolve the problem, the employee has the right to have her/his problem informally reviewed by the next level of supervision.

Step 3: If the matter is still unresolved to the satisfaction of the employee, she/he may file a formal grievance or complaint. The grievance must be filed in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the event or occurrence giving rise to the alleged grievance took place or within thirty (30) calendar days from the date on which the employee should have reasonably known of its occurrence.

The written grievance must include (1) a statement of the specific problem and/or complaint; (2) the Library policy violated or a statement as to why the employee feels the situation represents unfair or inequitable treatment; (3) all facts relevant to the problem and/or complaint; (4) a recommended solution; and (5) evidence establishing that all reasonable informal avenues to achieve a solution have been attempted. A copy must be forwarded to the Director of Human Resources at the time it is filed.

Step 4: The formal written grievance must be submitted to the appropriate Deputy Director within the time frame outlined in Step 3. The Deputy Director will conduct any necessary interviews and respond in writing to the grievance within five (5) working days from the date of receipt.

Step 5: If Step 4 does not resolve the grievance to the employee's satisfaction, the employee may appeal the decision within five (5) working days to the Library Director. The appeal must include a copy of the original grievance and any subsequent communication or documentation, including the written response from the Deputy Director. The Director will respond to the appeal in writing within five (5) working days from the date of receipt of the appeal and the Director's decision shall be administratively binding.

All employees of the Library are entitled to the above enumerated due process steps and fair consideration of their viewpoint under this procedure. No reprisals of any kind will be taken against any employee for participating in the grievance process.
