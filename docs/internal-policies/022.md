The Board may employ legal counsel to supply such legal assistance as may be required by the District as a corporate body. Generally, legal counsel shall work through the Library Director. Requests for a legal opinion or a legal review of a particular matter shall be channeled through the Library Director with the results of such opinion or review shared with all Board members.

Individual Board members shall have no authority to confer or seek a legal opinion directly from the Library's legal counsel, except when so authorized by action of the full Board. In the event that such legal advice is sought on behalf of the Board, the Library Director shall be informed of the request and receive a copy of any written response from legal counsel, except when the issue relates to employment of the Library Director or any matter in which the Board and the Library Director may be in adversarial roles.

The Library District shall not commence litigation as plaintiff without Board action and, except as required to protect Library District interest pending Board action, legal counsel shall not participate in litigation in defense of the District without Board approval. Legal counsel shall provide general services at the request of the Library Director, it being the responsibility of the Library Director to develop procedures which will assure adequate legal advice for himself and his subordinates, but avoid calling upon attorneys for matters which do not require their assistance.
