# POLICY PROPOSALS AND ACTION

In establishing Library Board policy the Board shall consider proposals from its members, from any Board committee, from the Library Administration or employees, or the general public. No policy proposal shall be considered before the Board and/or as having potential policy status until it has been submitted to the Board as an agenda item at a regular meeting of the Board and approved by a favorable vote of a majority of a quorum for placement on the policy calendar.

After a proposal has been on the policy calendar a minimum of ten (10) days, the proposal may be brought before the Board at any regular meeting by a majority vote of a quorum. A proposal may be amended or returned to the policy calendar by a majority vote of a quorum. Any material change in a proposal, by amendment or otherwise, shall cause the proposal to be returned to the policy calendar for a minimum of ten (10) days. A majority vote of the whole Board shall be required for approval of a policy proposal.
