A substantial amount of information of a current nature is needed from time to time by members of the Board in a satisfactory discharge of their duties. Such information may be in addition to the information provided to the Board in regular reports.

As a general rule Board members will request such additional information from the Library Director at a regular Board meeting. The request shall include a time schedule and permit the Library Director to respond at the next regular meeting except when the need is of an immediate nature. In such instances, it shall be the responsibility of the Library Director to respond promptly and to keep the Board member making the request informed as to the progress of the preparation of the information.

All Board members shall receive a copy of information so requested by and provided to individual members.
