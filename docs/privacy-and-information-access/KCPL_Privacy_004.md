This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to the Library's Web site: When you visit our Web site, we collect and store only the following information:

- The address (IP) of your computer or of your Internet provider
- The date and time you access our site
- The Internet address of the Web site which referred you to our site
- We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to you.
  Web site data is separate from individual users' library account data. In other words, we can't look up your library card number and see where you have been on the Web.

"Cookies" are used in conjunction with our Web2 catalog interface, but they do expire in a timely manner and do not contain personal information. (more about cookies)

The Library cannot be responsible for user's privacy when they disclose information to outside Web sites. It is the user's responsibility to protect their personal information. For example, be careful not to allow automatic logins to Web-based e-mail, close the Web browser when finished with a session, etc. (more about protecting your privacy on the Web)

We will not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute or disclose your e-mail address, postal address, phone number, borrower records or other personal information to outside parties unless required to do so by court order.

See Library Policy 105 for more information about Library customers' privacy.
