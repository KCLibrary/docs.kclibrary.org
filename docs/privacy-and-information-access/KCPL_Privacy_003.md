The Library is pleased to offer computers and computer-based services as part of our mission to provide materials that "educate, enrich, entertain, and inform" our customers. To provide the best possible services and prevent the abuse of these services, all customers must follow these guidelines.

The numbers in parentheses refer to the portion of the Library's Acceptable Use of Electronic Information Systems Policy from which the guideline was derived.

2. Customers may not attempt to modify or damage computer hardware or software. If there is hardware or software you feel should be part of the Library's electronic resources. (108.03)

   - the content of sources accessed through secondary links (108)
   - consequences arising from information obtained from the Internet or any other electronic resource (108.06)

   - an invasion of privacy (108.05)
