# Board/Administration division of labor

The Library Board determines policy, delegates executive and supervisory authority and responsibility to the Library Director, and appraises the results achieved by reference to the goals it has adopted for Library District operation. The Board shall concern itself primarily with broad questions of policy and with appraisal of results, rather than with administrative details. The application of policy is an administrative task to be performed by the Library Director.
