# Announcing meetings of the board and committees

Members of the Board and the general public shall be given notice of the time, place, date of each meeting of the Board, committees of the Board, and committees of non-Board members appointed by the Board, at least twenty-four hours in advance. As a minimum, such notice shall include posting on bulletin boards easily accessible to the public at the Main Library and the branch libraries. The notice shall contain a tentative agenda to be considered at the meeting. A copy of the notice and tentative agenda shall be available to any representative of the news media or general public upon request, and to representatives of the news media who have requested to receive all notices of the meetings of the Board or its committees.

In case it is necessary to hold a meeting without having given the minimum twenty-four hour prior notice as specified above, members of the Board may be notified by telephone and the good cause justifying the failure to give the notice shall be noted and stated in the minutes of the meeting.
