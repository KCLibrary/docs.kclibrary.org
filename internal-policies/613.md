# 613. Gift and Grant Funds Held by the Library District

The Board of Trustees of the Kansas City Public Library District intends to accept and receive designated funds from donors only to the extent that it is appropriate, practical and in the best interests of the Library to accomplish the donors intentions. If over time, the intent of the donor for the earnings from any fund or the corpus of any funds or property held by the Library becomes obsolete, impractical or inappropriate, the Board of Trustees reserves the right to redirect earnings or to re-designate the corpus in a manner consistent with the needs of the Library.
