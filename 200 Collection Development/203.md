# 203 Definition of Materials Selection

"Selection" refers to the decision that must be made either to add material to the collection or to retain material already in the collection. "Library materials'' and other synonyms as they may appear in this policy have the widest possible meaning; all forms of contemporary, recorded mass communication, from the traditional printed forms to the latest development in non-print media, are therefore included in this definition.
