# 206 Textbooks

Providing textbooks and curriculum materials is the responsibility of the schools. Textbooks will be purchased for the collection when they supply information in areas in which they may be the best, or the only, source of information on the subject. The public library shall not assume the responsibility for purchasing textbooks for wide and general distribution.
