## 313.01. Library System Closings for Inclement Conditions

Generally, the Library will not close for inclement weather conditions. Information concerning any closing of the Library will be given via Library Website, Library email, Library weather hotline 816.701.3599; and over social media. In addition, supervisors are responsible for keeping an accurate contact list of employees to be used in case of a library closing. If employees are unable to obtain the information, they should call their supervisor for the latest information. Determination of whether to close the Library will be made by the Library Director, or designee. If no notice is given, it is assumed that the Library will be open as usual.

## 313.02. Committee/Task Force Participation

The Library encourages staff interaction and development through involvement in committees, work/user groups and task forces. Frequently, participation in such group activities may be a function of the staff member's position, while participation in other activities may be voluntary.

Employees must obtain the approval of their immediate supervisor before committing to any in-house group activities and must have the additional approval of their Deputy Director for activities, committees, etc., outside of the Library.

Participation is open to the entire staff, but employees interested in voluntary activities should check with their supervisors before making a commitment to ensure that supervisors can provide the necessary flexibility in scheduling.

The intended purpose of the committee/task force structure is to:

1. improve overall communication and increase interdepartmental interaction;
2. increase the number of opportunities for staff from all levels of the Library to participate in skill development and continuing education;
3. enable staff to develop group interaction and leadership skills; and to
4. provide an opportunity for greater staff participation in decision making.

## 313.06. Retirement and Related Parties

"Sponsored" parties are defined as those in which funding is available from the Library's Activity Fund. Staff contributions, proceeds from vending machines and other donations finance the Activity Fund.

Regular full or part-time status employees are eligible to be honored with a Library sponsored retirement party if he or she meets certain criteria. Criteria includes the employee meeting or exceeding the "rule of 75," (meaning age and years of service combined equal 75) AND the recipient has been employed with the Library for at least 10 years.

For employees who do not meet the above criteria, the individual's department or branch may choose to honor the person with its own gift and/or party for such things as resignations, birthdays, etc. Lunch and break times may be utilized for this purpose.

Holiday celebratory parties "sponsored" by the Library shall also fall within financial guidelines set annually by the Library Director and the Finance Director.
