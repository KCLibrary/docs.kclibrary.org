# 204 Responsibility for Selection

Responsibility for the initial selection of books and other materials shall lie with the library's professional staff. The supervisors of Main and branches are responsible for the development of the adult circulating and reference collections, with designated professional staff being responsible for specific areas of the total collection. Other staff members and the general public may recommend materials for consideration. The ultimate responsibility for selection rests with the Library Director, operating within the framework of policies determined by the Board of Trustees of the Kansas City Public Library.
