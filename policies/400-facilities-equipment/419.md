# 419 Renaming Library Facilities

If a distinctive named Library facility is relocated, substantially remodeled, or converted to use other than its original use, the facility may be renamed to reflect the association of changed geography, new donors or community interests related to the changing facility. In such instances, the original name shall be honored in an appropriate manner.

The Board of Trustees shall have sole responsibility for renaming Library facilities and/or subunits of facilities, and all such requests will be brought to the Board as outlined in Board Policy 418.
