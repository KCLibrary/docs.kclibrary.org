# 517. The Budget Process

The budget process of the Library shall be a year-round activity involving broad participation by personnel throughout the system. The product of the process must harmonize available resources with the priorities of the Board of Trustees and the administrative objectives for responding to the priorities. As such the budget process shall be viewed as an integral element in all Library planning and projections. A budget calendar shall be developed annually and approved by the Board.

The Board of Trustees shall, before the beginning of the fiscal year, approve a preliminary budget and adopt such resolutions as may be required to authorize the budgeted expenditures and produce the revenues estimated in the budget. The board may, on its own motion or at the request of the Library Director, from time to time, amend or modify the approved budget.

On or before the 1st day of October of each year the Board of Trustees shall adopt a final budget for the year and fix its ad valorem property tax rates to produce the revenue required to meet the amounts contained in the budget. (Ref: 67.110 RSMo)

The budget or resolution required to authorize the expenditures proposed in the budget as finally adopted and any resolutions to amend or modify the approved budget shall remain on file for three years and shall be public records and open to inspection. (Ref: 67.060 RSMo)
