# 528. Private Grants or Gifts or Unanticipated Revenues

The Library District shall actively encourage grants and gifts, including real and personal property, from private sources which will further its mission and goals in serving the public. Such grants or gifts in support of existing programs and projects shall be routinely accepted and acknowledged by the Library Director and subsequently reported to the Library Board of Trustees.

Any offer of grant or gift funds from a private source which includes conditions or commitments on the part of the Library District outside the scope of established programs, projects or policies shall be accepted only by favorable action of the Board of Trustees.

Any one-time unrestricted and unanticipated revenue ("windfall") shall be recorded under appropriate revenue accounts of the Library's General Fund upon receipt. Some or all of the revenue may be allocated between the restoration of any shortfall to the fund balance and/or currently unfunded projects, subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees.
