# 534. Disposal of Obsolete Books, Equipment and Supplies

The Library Director shall establish procedures for identification and disposal of books equipment and supplies which are obsolete or otherwise not needed for Library purposes. All Library materials declared surplus shall be divided into two categories:

1. material considered to have substantial resale value; and
2. material due to obsolescence or wear that would be considered unusable.

Disposition of the two categories of material shall be as follows:

1. Saleable material shall be advertised as being declared surplus by the Library. An itemized listing of titles will not be required unless considered necessary by size, cost and/or condition of the item. Timing and character of sale shall be at the discretion of the Library Director; and
2. material classified as unusable shall be given away or destroyed.
