## Critical Thinking and Fact Finding

The News Literacy Project encourages you to pause and take a deep breath when you see a social media post that causes an emotional response. The next thing you can do is search out credible sources before sharing, liking, or commenting. You can also think like a journalist; CNN journalist Christina Zdanowicz uses [these questions to guide her next steps](https://newslitcampwithcnn.sched.com/speaker/christina_zdanowicz.7eh72xk):

- Who is this person?
- What is the photo showing? 
- What is the poster’s point of view?
- What is the larger story here? Are other news outlets reporting this story?
- What are the details on the story’s page? Does the page’s logo match the organization’s logo? Does the URL point to a real news organization?

Here is a [curated list](https://kclibrary.bibliocommons.com/list/share/1409627587/1774867959) of articles, books, and websites that can help you in your critical thinking and fact-finding journey.

A [federal eviction moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is in effect](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0121-eviction-moratorium.html) from September 4, 2020 to March 31, 2021 .

You can also use the [National Low Income Housing's federal eviction moratorium lookup tool](https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums) to see if your address is covered by one of the federal eviction bans.

Consider using [Propublica’s database](https://projects.propublica.org/covid-evictions/) to search apartment buildings nationwide to find out if your rental unit may qualify for eviction protection. (This database contains addresses for more than 177,000 buildings with five or more units that have mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; those insured by the Federal Housing Administration; and properties that are part of certain low-income housing programs. Some properties that qualify for federal protections, including ones with fewer than five units backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not in the Propublica database.)

**[Missouri Emergency Rental Arrears Program](https://www.mohousingresources.com/erap-program-overview) – landlords can submit applications in January 2021**
Starting in January 2021, the Missouri Housing Development Commission (MHDC), in conjunction with the Missouri Department of Social Services will make CARES Act COVID-19 Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG-CV) funds available to landlords for emergency rental arrears assistance. MHDC will post an online application packet, answers to frequently asked questions, and forms and templates to their website in January 2021. MHDC will email landlords updates about their application status. 

The Missouri Emergency Rental Arrears Program (ERAP) provides financial support for landlords and renters who are struggling due to the COVID-19 emergency in the State of Missouri.

The payment will not exceed the rent maximums by bedroom size [listed on their website](https://www.mohousingresources.com/erap-program-overview). Missouri Emergency Rental Arrears cannot be applied towards any fees or utilities.

To participate in the program, landlords must sign a guarantee of non-eviction for non-payment for 120 days from the date of the rental arrears application. By accepting rental assistance, landlords must waive any late fees, penalties, or outstanding rent as the date of application submission.
