1. Identify your name and city.

**Is my home covered by the Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac eviction bans or the CDC Moratorium?**

**Nolo.com** shared resources for you to use for the Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac eviction bans: visit [Fannie Mae](https://www.knowyouroptions.com/rentersresourcefinder) and [Freddie Mac](https://myhome.freddiemac.com/renting/lookup.html) and enter your address. 

You can also use the [National Low Income Housing's federal eviction moratorium lookup tool](https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums) to see if your address is covered by one of the federal eviction bans.

Consider using [Propublica’s database](https://projects.propublica.org/covid-evictions/) to search apartment buildings nationwide to find out if your rental unit may qualify for eviction protection. (This database contains addresses for more than 177,000 buildings with five or more units that have mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; those insured by the Federal Housing Administration; and properties that are part of certain low-income housing programs. Some properties that qualify for federal protections, including ones with fewer than five units backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not in the Propublica database.)

**[Missouri Emergency Rental Arrears Program](https://www.mohousingresources.com/erap-program-overview) – landlords can submit applications in January 2021**
Starting in January 2021, the Missouri Housing Development Commission (MHDC), in conjunction with the Missouri Department of Social Services will make CARES Act COVID-19 Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG-CV) funds available to landlords for emergency rental arrears assistance. MHDC will post an online application packet, answers to frequently asked questions, and forms and templates to their website in January 2021. MHDC will email landlords updates about their application status. 

The Missouri Emergency Rental Arrears Program (ERAP) provides financial support for landlords and renters who are struggling due to the COVID-19 emergency in the State of Missouri. The program will reimburse landlords for past due rent payments (rental arrears) for the period beginning April 1, 2020. A one-time payment of up to six (6) months of arrears will be made to the landlord on the tenant’s behalf. The payment will not exceed the rent maximums by bedroom size [listed on their website](https://www.mohousingresources.com/erap-program-overview). Missouri Emergency Rental Arrears cannot be applied towards any fees or utilities.

To participate in the program, landlords must sign a guarantee of non-eviction for non-payment for 120 days from the date of the rental arrears application. By accepting rental assistance, landlords must waive any late fees, penalties, or outstanding rent as the date of application submission.
