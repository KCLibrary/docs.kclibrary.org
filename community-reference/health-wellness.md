## KC COVID-19 Vaccination Resources

**Check your eligibility.**  Before making an appointment, [look here to find out if you meet the criteria to be vaccinated in Missouri](https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/). Some organizations allow you to add your name to a waiting list if you are not eligible yet, but some require that you wait until you are eligible to sign up.

**Which vaccine is best?** There are three vaccines authorized for use in the United States. They are manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.  [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends either](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html). More vaccines are currently in clinical trials and expected to be on the market at a future date.

**Sign up on multiple lists.** Vaccines are being offered at many different sites, but they don’t all share information.  The more places you can register, the better.  Do make sure you have transportation to a location before signing up on that list.  The Kansas City Health Department recommends that residents sign up for the State of Missouri Vaccine Registration first.

**Check with your employer.** Some employers partner with healthcare providers to provide vaccines for their employees. Check with your employer to see if this is an option for you. Some organizations are offering incentives for employees who get the vaccine.

**Be prepared for 2 doses.** When you get a COVID-19 vaccination, you will need to have a second shot about a month later. Be prepared to make two appointments and arrange for transportation for both. You will typically need to get your second dose at the same place where you receive the first dose.  

**You don’t have to have insurance, but you may be asked for it.** The COVID-19 vaccines are free and don’t require you to have insurance. However, if you do have insurance your insurance is required to pay for it. Organizations providing vaccine may ask for insurance. If you do have insurance, make sure to have your card handy when you are signing up. If you don't have insurance, remember that you are still eligible for the vaccine.

**What if I need help signing up?** Many vaccination registrations require you to complete an online form. However, there are some with phone numbers you can call and organizations that can help you to get on the list. (resources below)

**Be persistent.** When vaccine appointment times become available, they fill up quickly. It’s a good idea to check back regularly. 

**Be patient.** There is a high demand for vaccines in the Kansas City area, but the supply is currently low. It may take longer than you expected to get vaccinated.
