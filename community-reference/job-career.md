## Resumes & Cover Letters

### GENERAL ADVICE AND INFORMATION

- Tailor your resume for every application by including relevant keywords from the job description
- Many companies now use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to manage job applications; the systems scan resumes for keywords and typically work best with Microsoft Word documents
- Recruiters typically scan your resume for up to 20-30 seconds
- Proofread and have at least a second person review your resume

### CONTENT

- Always include contact information, work experience, and education; use action verbs to start each statement
- Replace basic job duties with impactful skills and accomplishments and eliminate words like “responsible for” and “duties included”
- For each experience, include the organization, position title, month and years, and location (city/state)
- Experience can be paid or unpaid. Other experience could include but is not limited to: volunteer, leadership, community involvement, etc.

### FORMATTING

- Typically 1 page in length; 2 pages with graduate level degree or higher; highly specialized or academic positions may require a CV of 2+ pages with no limit
- Use 10-12 point, easy to read font. Most utilized fonts include Calibri, Cambria, Times New Roman and Arial. Use consistent size and font
- Use bolding, italics, all caps to make the important things stand out (Name, section headers, position titles, etc)

### AVOID

- Borders, shading, photos, graphics; Personal information such as age, birthdate, parental or marital status, gender identity, race, hobbies etc.
- Avoid listing vague skills, such as “Good communication skills” or “strong team player.” Show excellent communication skills by talking about them the statements in experience section.
- “References available upon request” and Objective Statements are no longer necessary; references belong on a second separate page.
- Avoid personal pronouns “I” “me” “my” etc.
- Templates are helpful to get an idea of formatting, but sometimes cannot be read by ATS systems.

### WAYS TO SAVE YOUR DOCUMENT

- Microsoft Word Document (.doc or .docx) is best for uploading or attaching a resume to an online application.
- Plain Text (.txt) is best for copying and pasting a resume into the text boxes on an online application.
- Portable Document Format (.pdf) is best for emailing a resume directly to a hiring manager or human resources department. Note, some ATS systems cannot read PDFs.
- It is highly recommended to apply directly on the company’s website instead of posting a resume on job boards such as Indeed or Zip Recruiter.

Tips for attending a job fair:

What to wear: Whenever possible, wear business professional attire in neutral colors.

What to say: Prior to attending, research the organizations you want to speak with; information you might consider searching for includes the types of positions posted, background information on the organization and industry. Most of this can be found on organizations’ websites. You will also want to prepare an short introduction that includes your name, best skills, any relevant previous work experience, and why you are interested in working for the organization. After your introduction, you will be able to ask questions of the recruiter. Thoughtful questions that are based in the research on the organization will help you stand out!

What to bring: Bring updated copies of your resume, mints, a pen, paper, and questions for the recruiters. If you need help creating or updating your resume, check out our resume resources.
