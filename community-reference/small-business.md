## Where to Start

So, you want to be a business owner? Congratulations! Now where do you go from here?

If you haven’t already come up with a business idea, now is the time to really assess your strengths, passions and available resources. Who can you lean on? What do you already know how to do? How do you handle adversity? One of the most important things aside from your idea itself is being honest with yourself about the reasons why you want to become a business owner, assess your strengths, identify your opportunities of growth and start a game plan.

[Gale Business: Plan Builder](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/gale-business-plan-builder) is a tool you can rely on through every stage of your business planning; from pre-idea to when the point when it’s time to create your business plan to apply for financing or attract outside investors. 

Are you getting ready to validate your business idea for market viability and/or to assess the existing competitive landscape? We have two databases that can help you on this journey. Explore [AtoZdatabases](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/atozdatabases) for business lists that detail information including industry codes, financial health, employee size, and contact information. Explore [DemographicsNow](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/demographicsnow) to gain a preliminary understanding of market saturation, consumer demand and much, much more.

Are you trying to understand your existing customers more deeply? What channels of communication do they prefer, what kinds of behaviors are typical to them? [DemographicsNow](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/demographicsnow) has a great Customer Segmentation Tool that can provide this kind of information if you already have an existing customer list in the form of an excel spreadsheet. Set up a consultation with Hadiza Sa-Aadu today if you’d like assistance on how to generate this report for existing customers.

## Writing a Business Plan

One of your first steps to starting a business should be to write a business plan. A plan will help you organize your ideas to present to funders (such as banks and venture capitalists). Do your homework to get these startup dollars. Your business plan should include

- An executive summary that briefly describes why you are starting the business, and what consumer problem the product or service will solve
- An organizational plan that describes the staffing and management structure of the business
- A financial plan that describes the company’s startup budget
- A marketing plan that describes the market, industry trends, and ways the company will reach its intended customer audience
- Appendices or supporting documents

Community Reference services has several resources to assist with industry and market information (see above). We also have business plan samples in electronic format in several resources:

- [Gale Business: Plan Builder](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/gale-business-plan-builder) (accessible remotely with a Kansas City Public Library card)
- [Business Plans Handbook](<https://kclibrary.bibliocommons.com/search?custom_query=(title%3A(Business+Plans+HandbooK)+)>), available online via the database [Gale eBooks](https://kclibrary.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itweb/kans96975?db=GVRL).

The website [Bplans](http://www.bplans.com/) also has many good sample business plans.

## Get Legal: Licensing and Registering a Business

There are several steps to take to turn your business idea into reality. Here are some resources and services to help.

- The Missouri Secretary of State's [Starting a Business](http://www.sos.mo.gov/business/startBusiness) webpage. This page includes links to the required state forms and the new company registration system.
- The Secretary of State's [Search for a Business Entity](https://bsd.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/BESearch.aspx?SearchType=0) page. This page allows you to determine if your selected business name is available for use. The Library’s database [Legal Forms Library](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/legal-forms-library) (in consultation with an attorney) may also help you with this process.
- The staff of [KC BizCare](http://kcmo.gov/kcbizcare/about/), operated by the City of Kansas City, will assist you with the licensing process and other required local registrations.
- Remember to register with the [Missouri Department of Revenue](http://www.dor.mo.gov/) and the [IRS](http://www.irs.gov/) to be assigned an identification number to pay those taxes!
- Almost all entrepreneurs also need an attorney and an accountant. [Martindale.com](http://www.martindale.com/) is an excellent website for finding a good attorney.

## How to Research a Company

The ease and quantity of information you are able to find on a company depends a lot on whether it is a public or private company, large or small, local, national or international, as well as a number of other factors. It also depends on what kind of information you are trying to find.

The first thing you need to determine is if the company is publicly held. Of the millions of companies in the United States, only a small handful are public companies.

- Publicly held companies are those that you and I can purchase shares of stock (shares of ownership) in. Stock can be purchased through a broker on any day that the stock market is open.
- Privately held companies are those that are owned by a limited number of people (founder, key employees, and/or investors). You and I cannot purchase a share of the company.

There are several resources you can use to determine if a company is publicly held.

- Use [AtoZdatabases](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/atozdatabases) (Library card required from home) and search for the company name. The company entry will indicate if the company is public or private.
- Use Google to pull up the company's web page. Look for a link to "Investor" or "Investor Relations." This is sometimes under the "About Us" tab.
- [Ask one of the librarians in the Business & Career Center for assistance](https://www.kclibrary.org/contact-us-form?id=26910&email=0).

**PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES**

It is relatively easy to find information on publicly held companies, as they are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports in turn are made available to the public.

- These reports can be accessed by [SEC's EDGAR database](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml).
- The website [FormDs.com](http://www.formds.com/) allows you to search for the SEC forms that startups and investments firms must file when they raise money.

Publicly held companies for the most part are the largest and most influential companies. Consequently, their actions and products are well covered by newspaper and magazine reporters. The library subscribes to several databases that can help you find articles about the company you are researching.

- [Business Insights: Global](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/business-insights-global) will provide you with the full text of articles taken from a wide range of business magazines and trade journals. Company reports, market research reports, and profiles of publicly traded companies worldwide are also provided in this database.
  (_Library card is required to access all of these resources from outside the Library._)

**PRIVATE COMPANIES**

It is much more difficult to find information about private companies as they are not required to make information about themselves public. The size of the company often determines how much information is going to be found.

- Start with [AtoZdatabases](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/atozdatabases). This database is a directory of tens of millions of businesses from all over the world. In addition to contact information, business listings include:
  - Owners/manager's name
  - Estimated sales
  - Number of employees
  - Link to their website
  - Years in business
- Information on large private companies is also available in [Business Insights: Global](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/business-insights-global). This database gives you access to articles in trade journals. Trade journals are written specifically for people working in a particular industry or trade. They may have reports on important small companies in an industry and news not covered in other sources.
  (_Library card is required to access all of these resources from outside the Library._)
- Check to see if the company has a listing in the [FormDs.com](http://www.formds.com/) website.

**LOCAL COMPANIES**

If the business you want information on is a smaller local company, there are specific resources that could be of help to you. Take a look at the guide on [Local Business and Economic Information](https://kclibrary.org/business-career/local-business-and-economic-information) in the Business and Career Center.

**COMPANY WEBSITES**

Don't forget to look at a company's own website. A Google search will help you find a business's website. Often you can learn a great deal about a company (products, services, locations, contact names, history) from their website. Remember though, this is not unbiased information.

Use the website [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) to learn about different aspects of a company as an employer. This includes salary information, company reviews, and the company's interview process.

## Industry Research

**WHO SHOULD RESEARCH AN INDUSTRY?**

- Entrepreneurs studying the industry they are entering.
- Small business owners who are writing their business plan.
- Job/career seekers who are preparing for a job interview or exploring career options.
- Investors exploring stock purchases.
- Marketers, product developers, and small business owners looking for new markets to enter.

1. Begin your research by identifying the NAICS or industry code that represents the product or service you are interested in.

   You will find most industry information aggregated by [NAICS codes](http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/). NAICS stands for North American Industry Classification System and was designed by the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican governments to keep track of economic activity. The codes represent the manufacture, wholesale and retail of products as well as services provided. Consequently, every business can be identified by at least one and often several NAICS codes. Another industry coding system, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) System, may also be helpful for you in your research. [SIC codes](https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sicsearch.html) are older than the NAICS coding system, but sometimes they are much more descriptive for a particular industry than NAICS codes. As with NAICS codes, businesses can be assigned multiple SIC codes. The primary industry code (NAICS or SIC) for publicly traded companies is available on the company’s [Form 10-K](http://www.sec.gov/answers/form10k.htm).

2. You will want to identify the businesses who are already engaged in this industry.
   To identify the large companies, use [Business Insights: Global](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/business-insights-global). Business Insights includes profiles of companies from all over the world. (_Library card is required to access this resource from outside the Library._)

   You might be more interested in the smaller companies and/or the local companies in your industry. To find these companies use AtoZdatabases. AtoZ includes only US companies, while Business Insights includes US and international companies. (Library card is required to access these resources from outside the Library.)

3. What trends are currently impacting your industry?: Technology, new products, the economy, demographic changes, regulations, new competition, changes in lifestyles? You can read about your industry by using
   - [Business Insights: Global](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/business-insights-global) This database includes hundreds of comprehensive industry reports, including major companies, trends, and financial information. (Library card is required to access this database from outside the Library).
   - The website [Bizminer](http://www.bizminer.com/) has many excellent US industry market reports, but they are not free. Each reports costs around \$100.
   - [Kansas City Business Journal](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/kansas-city-business-journal) is an excellent source of information regarding local businesses and industries. You can search the Business Journal online going back to 1996. If the full text of the article is not available online, the Library has copies of all of the issues.
4. Statistical sources can give you another look at your industry.
   - [The Economic Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html), completed every five years, contains information that can help entrepreneurs to evaluate industry growth, and identify new markets and product lines.
   - The [Industry Statistics Portal](http://www.census.gov/econ/isp/) is a great place to start to access Census information about your industry. This site is a faster way of accessing the industry data that is also contained in [Census Bureau Data](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/census-bureau-data).
   - [County Business Patterns](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp.html) are prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using a NAICS code, you will find the number of establishments, number of people employed and the annual payroll figure for specific industries.
   - The above-mentioned reports do not include those businesses that are one-person operations. To get data on businesses that have no paid staff use [Nonemployer Statistics](http://www.census.gov/econ/nonemployer/index.html) prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau.
5. Trade associations can provide a wealth of information to you. Because their members are all active in the industry and share information, they have a very good handle on what is happening in their particular field. There are trade associations for just about any line of work. To find the one(s) that represent your industry use [Encyclopedia of Associations](https://kclibrary.bibliocommons.com/item/show/111012120_encyclopedia_of_associations).

## Demographic Research

Demographics are statistics about people: How many people live in a specific area, where they work, what they buy, and how they live. These statistics can shape the delivery of a new product or service, or where a business is located.

**THE US CENSUS**

It is mandated that every ten years, the U.S. Census Bureau count all of the people in the United States and Puerto Rico. Along with counting the people, the Census Bureau also collects certain economic and social characteristics about everyone. Rather than doing the long form every 10 years, the Census Bureau is now taking an annual American Community Survey which provides an estimated count of many socioeconomic characteristics. The questions asked are those that help federal and state agencies carry out the services they provide as mandated by Congress. This mandate is a benefit to business owners, social service agencies and others who need demographic information.
The following information can get you started on your research.

**CENSUS BUSINESS BUILDER**

An online source you should consult first is [Census Business Builder](https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools/cbb.html). CBB is an interactive website that provides access to useful demographic and economic data from the Census Bureau and other reliable sources in an easy-to-use, map-based format.

**CENSUS BUREAU DATA**

If you are looking for basic demographic information, use [Census Bureau Data](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/census-bureau-data), a website created and maintained by the [U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/). Very quickly, you can pull up a fact sheet on:

- States
- Cities/towns
- Counties
- Zip codes

Statistics are given for more than 40 variables, including:

- Population Characteristics
- Social Characteristics
- Housing Characteristics
- Economic Characteristics

**DEMOGRAPHICS NOW**

[Demographics Now](https://www.kclibrary.org/research-resources/research-databases/demographicsnow) provides detailed demographic reports. Assess business viability, perform market and site location analysis, create sales leads and/or marketing mailing lists, find potential sponsors and donors to grow a non-profit, prepare a small business plan and much more.

**AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY**

The [American Community Survey](http://www.census.gov/acs/www/) (ACS) was created to give not just federal programs more timely data, but to also help you, the business owner, student, activist, and community organizer, the current demographic, social, economic and housing data that you need. The ACS:

- Is an on-going annual survey
- Is sent to a sample of the population
- Tells us what the population looks like and how it lives
- Helps communities determine where to locate services and allocate resources.
- Helps business people determine locations of characteristic populations.

The ACS will give you more detailed data than what is found in Census Bureau Data but only for larger geographical areas. The annual statistics are provided for places with populations of 65,000 or more, while the 3-year estimate data is provided for geographic populations of 20,000 or more. The geographic breakdowns include:

- State
- County
- City
- Unified School District

Data found in ACS but not on the Factfinder Factsheets include:

- Ancestry breakdown
- Marital status
- Count of women in normal child-bearing years
- School enrollment
- Householder relationship

**OTHER SOURCES OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA**

- The [Mid-American Regional Council](http://marc.org/) (MARC) is the regional planning organization for nine counties and 120 cities. MARC maintains a website called [Metro Dataline](http://www.marc.org/Data-Economy/Metrodataline) that includes some Census data as well as other statistics for the metropolitan area.
- The [Missouri Census Data Center](http://mcdc2.missouri.edu/) is an agency that provides access to State-level Census Bureau data.

**BOOKS**

The Community Reference area on the third floor of the [Central Library](https://kclibrary.org/library-locations/central-library) also has several print resources that may help you with your demographic research.

## Statistical Research

Statistics are used to prove points, bolster arguments, support needs, justify an existence and much more. What we buy, where we work, what we do in our spare time, and our health all get translated into statistics that are studied by businesses, governments, and academicians. Statistics are a part of our everyday life yet they can be baffling to understand and difficult to find.

As you start your statistics research, ask yourself these questions:

- What specific statistics do I need to find?
- What geographic level (state, county, zip code, census tract) do I need?
- Do I need just the current figures or do I want historical numbers for trend analysis?
- Do I need economic statistics (number of businesses, employment figures) or demographic/social characteristic numbers? For demographic research information, check our <span style="background-color:red;">[Demographic Research](https://kclibrary.org/business-career/demographic-research) guide</span>.

Census Business Builder, the Economic Census, and FedStats

An online source you should consult first is [Census Business Builder](https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools/cbb.html). CBB is an interactive website that provides access to useful demographic and economic data from the Census Bureau and other reliable sources in an easy-to-use, map-based format.

The Census Bureau also completes a survey of businesses every five years. The [Economic Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html) gives the number of businesses, employment, and payroll figures broken down by industry type (NAICS) and by geography.

Another good starting point is [FedStats](http://fedstats.sites.usa.gov/), the federal government's comprehensive statistics portal.

**OTHER FEDERAL ECONOMIC DATA SOURCES**

In addition to the Census, other federal agencies that provide useful statistics include

- The Department of Commerce' [Economics & Statistics Administration](http://www.esa.doc.gov/about-economic-indicators)
- The [Economic Report of the President](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=ERP)
- The [Bureau of Economic Analysis](http://www.bea.gov/)
- The [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/)

Other government agencies collect data related to their area of responsibility. Statistics regarding education, health, labor, crime, food, housing, transportation and other topics are available.

**KANSAS CITY AREA STATISTICS**

Although federal statistical sources provide some local data, there are additional sources. The [Mid-American Regional Council](http://marc.org/) (MARC) is the regional planning organization for nine counties and 120 cities. MARC maintains a website called [Metro Dataline](http://www.marc.org/Data-Economy/Metrodataline) that includes some Census data as well as a wealth of metro-level economic, demographic and transportation statistics.
